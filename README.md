# CS640-Lab3

For this lab, we modify the virtual router to:
1. Generate Internet Control Messaging Protocol (ICMP) messages when error conditions
occur.
2. Populate the ARP cache by generating and consuming Address Resolution Protocol
(ARP) messages.
3. Build a routing table using distance vector routing. With these changes, your virtual
router will no longer depend on a static ARP cache or static route table, and it will be
pingable and traceable.
